Done:
- Basic UI
- Redux store setup
- Add and delete todo implemented (buggy)
- Animations (buggy)

Up next:
- Figure out how to handle todos that exceed the width of the Segment
- Utilize local storage

In the future:
- Categories w/ color indicators?
- React router for multiple pages

Bugs found:
- If there are multiple todos w/ the same content, deleting one will delete them all
- Fade out animation always fades out the last todo, even if it's deleting a different todo
