Done:
- Basic UI
- Redux store setup
- Add and delete todo implemented (buggy)
- Animations (buggy)

Up next:
-

In the future:
- Settings button
- Find a more elegant way to display multiple lines of text on a todo
- Categories w/ color indicators?
- React router for multiple pages

Bugs found:
- If there are multiple todos w/ the same content, deleting one will delete them all
- Fade out animation always fades out the last todo, even if it's deleting a different todo

What have I learned:
- You need to use store.getState() in a subscribed listener in order to get the state post-dispatch. If you use the value of a selector, it will give you the old state.
